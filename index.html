          The road trip from my house in Charotte, NC to Disneyland in Orlando,
          FL was about 525 miles and took about 7 hours and 30 minutes by car. 
          Everyone that went was my mom, my two brothers, and myself.

            The only downside was how long the line was. It took over an hour to
            get through. However, even this wasn't that bad because this whole area
            was modelled after the movie. There were a lot of cool props to look at
            while you wait in line, including a full size Avatar.

            My favorite ride at the park was the Flight of Passage
            inspired by the moive Avatar. This ride is a 3D immersion experience
            that simulates riding one of the fictional dragon type creatures from
            movie called a Banshee. This was my favoirte ride I have ever been on
            at any amusement park.
